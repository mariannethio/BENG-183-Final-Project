## What is Precision Medicine?
Precision medicine is a new and modern approach to understanding health by tailoring medical treatments to the individual characteristics of each patient. Precision medicine takes into consideration that each individual has personal variations in their genome sequencing due to mutations and their environmental exposure. It proposes the customization of the patient’s healthcare such as their medical decisions, treatments, and practices. Although the definition is misinterpreted to mean that drugs and medical devices are created uniquely to a patient, but it actually the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in the susceptibility to a particular disease.

Often times personalized medicine can be used instead of precision medicine. Originally, personalized medicine was used, but due to the concern that personalized medicine could be misinterpreted to imply that treatments and preventions are being developed uniquely for each individual. That is why, personalized medicine was replaced with precision medicine. Precision medicine instead implied more of a focus on identifying which approach will be effective for which patients based on a patient’s genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Although precision medicine is the proper term, precision medicine and personalized medicine can be used interchangeably.

Precision medicine is a different approach in comparison to the traditional medicinal approach, where there are standard tests and common drugs used to treat patients with the same symptoms. The traditional approach disregards individual's genetic variation and their reaction to drugs. Precision medicine allows doctors to select the best treatment that are most likely to help their patient, which are based on their genetic variation and the genetic understanding of their disease.

Precision medicine works by collecting, connecting, and analyzing information about an individual and their diseases. Precision medicine requires a patient's genetics, a patient's health history, their response to a disease, their lifestyle and information about the underlying causes of a disease. This information can come from a fitness tracker or from scientists that are currently discovering new facts about a disease in their lab. With all this information, scientists and researchers can understand an individual's health risk, how individuals respond to a disease or drug, ways to prevent diseases, and ultimately identifying treatments that will be effective for the patient. The more information that is collect, the better scientists and researchers will have in understanding health and ensures that every patient gets the right treatment, in the right dose, and at the right time.

Precision medicine involves the application of panomic analysis and systems biology to analyze the cause of an individuals patient’s disease at the molecular level and then to utilize targeted treatments to address that individual patient’s disease process. Panomic analysis is the analysis of molecular biology technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, metabolic, and transcriptomics. Systems biology is the computational and mathematical modeling of complex biological systems. 

### History of Precision Medicine Through the Lens of Breast Cancer Treatment
In the 1970s, one of the treatments to breast cancer was the removal of the ovaries. With no ovaries, there was no release of estrogen and therefore no growth in the tumor. However, the removal of the ovaries only helped 70% of the patients with ER+ (estrogen-receptor positive) tumor. This showed the importance in how tumor cells are built, such as their genetic programming, markers on the surface and the growth circuit. With 70% of the breast cancer patients being ER+, it was found that they could be treated with an anti-estrogen agent that blocked the tumor growth. Then in the 1984s, microarray and gene expression profiling techniques were used to discover that a strain of breast caner developed from the abnormal HER-2 gene expression, which affected 20% of the patients. This lead to the development of a new drug called Herceptin. Herceptin inhibits the function of the protein created by the abnormal HER-2 gene.

In the 1990s, 5% of the breast cancer patients were found to have inherited the defect in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Although there is no preventive treatment, patient can be screened and watched for tumor formation closely. The overall history of treating breast cancer found that 85% of the breast cancer patient could be categorized and treated according to whether the tumor depended on estrogen to grow, whether the tumor proliferated by producing too many HER-2 proteins, or if there were any flaws in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. Categorizing the cancer based on the specific abnormalities of the tumor before treating it can increase the percentage of patients who will benefit from the treatment.

### Precision Medicine in Cancer
The 3 main cancers focused in society include Lung Cancer, Kidney Cancer, and Breast Cancer. The current treatment for cancers includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. However, which treatment is chosen depends on the type of cancer a patient has, the size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread, or metastasized. Tumors with the same origin may be different in appearances, behavior, aggressiveness and vulnerability. With precision medicine, information about genetic changes

### Pharmacogenomics
Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes affect a person’s response to a particular drug. Pharmacogenomics combines both pharmacology and genomics to develop effective, safe medications and doses that will be tailored to a person’s genetic makeup. This allows for a different approach from the “one size fits all” that are currently available for many drugs. However, the issue with this approach is that it is difficult to predict who will benefit from the medication, who will not respond at all, and who will experience negative side effects, which is a significant cause of hospitalization and deaths in the United States. With the information gained from the Human Genome Project, researches and scientists are leaning how inherited differences in the genes affect the body’s response to medications. These genetic differences will be able to predict whether a medication will be effective for a particular person and to help prevalent people from having negative side effects. Because pharmacogenomics is still relatively new the use is currently limited. However, in the future, pharmacogenomics will allow for the development of tailored drugs to treat a wide range of health problems.
